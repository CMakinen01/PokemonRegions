A Gatsby site that incorporates JavaScript and CSS. The "Intro", "General", and "Regions" pages are mainly static, and the "Lookup" page uses React components to search up any Pokemon by ID. The "Team" page uses the same React components to search for Pokemon, as well as additional components to add, clear, and rate a Pokemon team.
